## Description

* This webpage is to be able to have a random movie, food and drink selected to create the perfect date! 
* Our motivation to create this project is to help couples decide on a dinner/movie date without fighting over what to select.
* Our group designed this webpage to help understand how to work together on a group project through Github and further our knowledge on API calls.
* The webpage allows the user to generate a random movie, food and drink for their date. While also being able to rate their previous dates based on the random selections.
* <!- We need to enter what we learned from this group project -->
