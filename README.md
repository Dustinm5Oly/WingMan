## This webpage is to be able to have a random movie, food and drink selected to create the perfect date! 

    -Our motivation to create this project is to help couples decide on a dinner/movie date without fighting over what to select.
    -Our group designed this webpage to help understand how to work together on a group project through Github and further our knowledge on API calls.
    -The webpage allows the user to generate a random movie, food and drink for their date. While also being able to rate their previous dates based on the random selections.
    <!- We need to enter what we learned from this group project -->
